# Ranked Matches Calculator

### Objective

Create a function that takes the number of wins and losses of a player as parameters and returns the result to a variable. The Ranked Matches balance should be calculated using the formula (wins - losses).

To determine the player's position in the ranking, use the following classification:

> If the number of wins is less than 10 = Iron <br>
> If the number of wins is between 11 and 20 = Bronze <br>
> If the number of wins is between 21 and 50 = Silver <br>
> If the number of wins is between 51 and 80 = Gold <br>
> If the number of wins is between 81 and 90 = Diamond <br>
> If the number of wins is between 91 and 100 = Legendary <br>
> If the number of wins is greater than or equal to 101 = Immortal <br>
